# FdF - Wireframe 3D Graphics Project
FdF is a captivating 3D graphics project. The name FdF, short for "Fil de Fer" (Wireframe), aptly describes the project's primary objective: to render and display 3D landscapes as wireframe models. This project is based mainly on 3D graphics and transformations.

The FdF project is a simple yet powerful program that can read height maps (often referred to as landscapes or terrains) from data files and render them as a 3D wireframe model on the screen. Users can navigate through these landscapes, exploring the contours and elevation changes, all while maintaining a real-time 3D perspective.

# Key Features

* Wireframe Rendering: FdF renders landscapes as wireframe models, showcasing the spatial relationships between the various data points.

* Rotation and Zoom: Users can interact with the rendered landscapes by rotating and zooming to get a better view of the terrain.

* Color Mapping: Elevations can be represented using colors, allowing for a more intuitive understanding of the terrain's features.

* User-Friendly Interface: FdF features a user-friendly interface that enables smooth navigation and interactivity.
